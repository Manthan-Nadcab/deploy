The Backtesting Analysis page provides comprehensive tools for analyzing and comparing the performance of your trading strategy backtests.

## Features

### 📊 Performance Analysis
- **Strategy Performance Metrics**: View detailed metrics including total P&L, win rate, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown
- **Trade-by-Trade Analysis**: Examine individual trades with entry/exit times, prices, and P&L
- **Performance Visualization**: Interactive charts showing cumulative returns, drawdown periods, and trade distribution
- **Multi-Backtest Comparison**: Compare performance across multiple backtests side-by-side

### 📈 Advanced Analytics
- **Statistical Analysis**: Distribution plots for returns, trade duration, and P&L
- **Risk Metrics**: Comprehensive risk analysis including VaR, CVaR, and risk-adjusted returns
- **Market Correlation**: Analyze strategy performance relative to market conditions
- **Time-based Analysis**: Performance breakdown by hour, day, and month

### 🔍 Trade Insights
- **Trade Clustering**: Identify patterns in winning and losing trades
- **Entry/Exit Analysis**: Evaluate the effectiveness of entry and exit signals
- **Position Sizing**: Analyze the impact of position sizes on overall performance
- **Fee Impact**: Understand how trading fees affect profitability

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Select Backtests
- Choose one or more completed backtests from the dropdown menu
- Filter backtests by date range, strategy type, or performance metrics
- Load historical backtests from saved results

### 2. Configure Analysis
- Select the metrics and visualizations you want to display
- Set date ranges for focused analysis
- Choose comparison benchmarks (e.g., buy-and-hold, market indices)

### 3. Analyze Results
- Review performance summary cards showing key metrics
- Explore interactive charts by zooming, panning, and hovering for details
- Export analysis results as reports (PDF/CSV)
- Save analysis configurations for future use

### 4. Compare Strategies
- Add multiple backtests to the comparison view
- Align backtests by date for fair comparison
- Identify which strategies perform best under different market conditions

## Technical Notes

### Data Processing
- Backtesting results are loaded from the backend storage system
- Large datasets are processed incrementally for optimal performance
- Caching is implemented for frequently accessed analysis results

### Visualization Components
- **Plotly**: Interactive charts with zoom, pan, and export capabilities
- **Pandas**: Efficient data manipulation and statistical calculations
- **NumPy**: High-performance numerical computations

### Performance Considerations
- Analysis of large backtests (>10,000 trades) may take several seconds
- Charts are rendered progressively to maintain UI responsiveness
- Memory usage is optimized through data chunking
